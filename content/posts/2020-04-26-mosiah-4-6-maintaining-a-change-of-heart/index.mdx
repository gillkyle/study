I enjoyed reading Elder Renlund's conference talk from a few years back that related to the events of King Benjamin's time in Mosiah.

The people are moved to repent and promise to change, saying they had felt a "mighty change" within them.

<Scripture
  title="Mosiah 5:2"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2?lang=eng"
>
  2 And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words
  which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth,
  because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty
  change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil,
  but to do good continually.
</Scripture>

A linked talk from the Come, Follow Me reading was Elder Renlund's talk titled Preserving the Heart's Mighty Change. Thinking about covenants as a new heart is very interesting because what happens next is so much more important than any singular event. If a transplanted heart is rejected by the body in the coming days or weeks, the transplant isn't of much worth. Likewise, if a spiritual change of heart fails from a lack of enduring the end, what does it profit us?

Elder Renlund said:

  Please consider the state of your changed heart. Do you detect any rejection
  setting in as a result of the tendency of the natural man to become casual? If
  so, find a place where you too can kneel. Remember, more than mortal years on
  this earth are at stake. Do not risk forfeiting the fruits of the ultimate
  operation: eternal salvation and exaltation.
</Scripture>

I think the events in Mosiah 4 & 5 are much like the operation of a heart transplant. What is really interesting though is what happens next for those people. Similarly, when I was baptized or made other promises with God, what do I do next?
