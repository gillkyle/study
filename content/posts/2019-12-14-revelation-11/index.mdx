The book of Revelation is full of symbolism that—similiar to Jesus' parables—can take effort to unravel but feels rewarding to [make plain](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.4?lang=eng).

So what exactly does the phrase "worthy is the lamb" mean?

## Power in Music

Quoting scripture in Revelation 5, the song [Worthy Is The Lamb That Was Slain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngSsaSimi8A) from Handel's Messiah proclaims "blessing and honor, glory and power be unto Him forever". Like other choruses of the Messiah, it lines up precisely with text from the Bible. The verses are cherrypicked from Revelation 5 that center around the Savior's perfect sacrifice.

<Scripture>
  13 And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the
  earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying,
  <b>
    Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon
    the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.
  </b>
</Scripture>

The lamb with 7 eyes and 7 horns (7 representing perfection or completion) that John saw was the only one "worthy" to open the scroll. When the lamb takes the scroll from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne a powerful symbol emerges as the beasts and elders turn from worshipping the throne, and worship the Lamb.

<Scripture>
  7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the
  throne.
  <br />8 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders
  <b> fell down before the Lamb</b>...
</Scripture>

The Lamb is divine, and worthy of worship. His being the only to be able to open the scroll demonstrates how He was the only one capable of saving the world from death. The elders and beasts turn now to the Lamb.

## Worthy of worship, worthy to be celebrated

Because a sacrificial Lamb was given, each of us is able to be forgiven of sin. Worthy is the Lamb means the Savior was capable of saving, which is a cause worth celebrating and rememberinig each day through righteous living.
