God teaches and instructs in a myriad of "mysterious ways". Examining the world and how it subsists can teach some profound lessons about individual life.

## Parallels in the Creation of Earth and of Mankind

In the beginning God created the earth. On the third day of creation the waters were separated from the dry land:

<Scripture
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1.9?lang=eng"
  title="Genesis 1:9"
>
  9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto bone
  place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
</Scripture>

A variety of prophets of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints [have stated](http://www.mormonthink.com/QUOTES/earth.htm) that the earth can be considered a living being much like any other person. A parallel idea referred to as the [Gaia hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis) is a comparable idea from the secular world. The basis of the concept is that the earth acts and behaves harmoniously much like one living thing, similar to how all the cells and organelles of the body interact and support one another to live, the earth is considered by these ideas to act much the same.

If this idea is analyzed in the context of the Creation, some interesting parallels begin to present themselves:

1. like the soul of man is comprised of 2 parts: body and spirit, the earth is comprised 2 parts: sea and dry land
2. like mankind was created first spiritually before it was created physical, the creation of the earth was planned much before it was organized

We live on the surface of earth that the God's divided from the seas to give beauty to the earth, the ocean we picture in our minds as an infinite expanse of placid water, and the beauty is deeper than surface level.
We see the variety in the earth's surface, the mountains, jungles, cities that dot the globe and make it beautiful, but the beauty of the ocean lives far out of sight.
What is happening beneath the surface that we should be aware of?
