This week while studying Easter topics for Come, Follow Me, I encountered a verse in Matthew 28 that I found very meaningful.

<Scripture
  title="Matthew 28:6"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/28.6?lang=eng"
>
  6 He is not here: for <b>he is risen, as he said</b>. Come, see the place
  where the Lord lay.
</Scripture>

When the angel responds to both Marys, there's the short quip that "he is risen, as he said" that I let myself focus on. "As he said" is very comforting, for 3 days many in the Christian world wept because their Savior had died. But, Jesus had already promised He would rise again ([Matt 12:38-39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/12.38-39?lang=eng), [John 2:18-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/2.18-19?lang=eng)), and even the Pharisees remembered it (hence why the rock was placed in front of the garden tomb).

<Scripture
  title="Matthew 27:62-63"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/28.6?lang=eng"
>
  62 Â¶ Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief
  priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,
  <br />
  63 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive,
  After three days I will rise again.
</Scripture>

I like thinking about this story overlayed on the Savior's 2nd Coming. I imagine there will be a day similar when things are difficult and seem bleak, and an angel will say "He has come, as he said". Knowing that God fulfills his promises and that He _has_ said He will return, I find comfort in Easter not solely for the Resurrection.

We will live again, and we will also see God again, and all God's promises will be fulfilled.
