excerpt: Abbinadi taught that the Law of Moses points us to Christ like a shadow attached to Him

I loved how Abinadi turns the question from the priests of Noah back at them. He answers their question when they quote Isaiah: "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings".

They are convinced they the Law of Moses will save, yet even that they aren't living. Abinadi is very clear and I love this verse that makes a beautiful visual:

<Scripture title="Mosiah 16:14-15" link="">
  14 Therefore, if ye teach the law of Moses, also teach that it is a shadow of
  those things which are to comeâ€”
  <br />
  15 Teach them that redemption cometh through Christ the Lord, who is the very
  Eternal Father. Amen.
</Scripture>

If the Savior is what saves, the law of Moses is just a shadow that is cast by the Savior. It lacks substance and really has no ability to do anything, but by tracing it back to its source, we discover Christ. "Redemption cometh through Christ", not some shadow extended off from Him.
