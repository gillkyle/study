I enjoyed this verse from Alma 41 this week:

<Scripture
  title="Alma 41:8"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.8?lang=eng"
>
  8 Now, the decrees of God are unalterable;{" "}
  <b>
    therefore, the way is prepared that whosoever will may walk therein and be
    saved
  </b>
  .
</Scripture>

I love that it isn't that the way _will be_ prepared, it _is_ prepared. There's already the resources and tools available to find happiness. I say happiness because being "saved" in the eternities feels like a close indicator of happiness.

Agency means we can choose the path.
