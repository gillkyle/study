Jacob has some interesting insight from this week's Come, Follow Me study that parallels circumstances in world:

<Scripture
  title="Jacob 4:9-10"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.9-10?lang=eng"
>
  9 For behold, by the power of his word man came upon the face of the earth,
  which earth was created by the power of his word. Wherefore, if God being able
  to speak and the world was, and to speak and man was created, O then, why not
  able to command the earth, or the workmanship of his hands upon the face of
  it, according to his will and pleasure?
  <br />
  10 Wherefore, brethren,{" "}
  <b>seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand</b>. For
  behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and
  in great mercy, over all his works.
</Scripture>

God created the earth, and is the master of it. In times of trial and crisis, it's easy to seek to counsel the Lord, urging Him to provide relief or solutions that one dreams up themself.

Rather, we should "take consel from his hand". When the prophet speaks, we listen. With announcements changing procedures in churches, temples, and activities of the global church as a result of COVID-19, we are wise to follow the Lord's counsel and be hygenic, and prepared.

The line of a hymn also comes to mind in relation to this topic:

<Scripture
  title="Master, the Tempest is Raging"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/music/library/hymns/master-the-tempest-is-raging"
>
  Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea
  <br />
  Or demons or men or whatever it be,
  <br />
  No waters can swallow the ship where lies
  <br />
  The Master of ocean and earth and skies.
  <br />
  They all shall sweetly obey thy will:
  <br />
  Peace, be still; peace, be still.
</Scripture>

"Whatever it be", "Peace, be still", because God can calm our individual storms.
