excerpt: The war in heaven continues on earth as everyone is pulled in opposite directions towards good and evil.

The book of Revelation is full of symbolism that—similiar to Jesus' parables—can take effort to unravel but feels rewarding to [make plain](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.4?lang=eng).

## The War in Heaven continues on earth

By keeping our first estate, we came to earth. On earth we're blessed with a body, something that not everyone present in the pre-earth council will have.

[Nephi saw](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14.12-14?lang=eng) the last days and how the war would continue to rage on:

<Scripture
  title="1 Nephi 14:12-14"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14.12-14?lang=eng"
>
  12 And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and{" "}
  <b>its numbers were few</b>, because of the wickedness and abominations of the
  whore who sat upon many waters; nevertheless, I beheld that the church of the
  Lamb, who were the saints of God, were also upon all the face of the earth;
  and their dominions upon the face of the earth were small, because of the
  wickedness of the great whore whom I saw. <br />
  13 And it came to pass that I beheld that the great mother of abominations did
  gather together multitudes upon the face of all the earth, among all the nations
  of the Gentiles, to fight against the Lamb of God. <br />
  14 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God,
  that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the
  covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the
  earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in
  great glory.
</Scripture>

The numbers of the church of the Lamb of God "were few", meaning it would be increasingly difficult to stay true to path that the Savior set. Knowing we kept our first estate is promising because it means we've already once chosen to follow the Savior instead of the adversary. Having done so once makes it feel like there's a little more easiness accepting the idea that it's very much possible to do again. The reward for keeping the first estate was a body, the reward for keeping the second estate is eternal life.

## The Lord invites me to flee Babylon and her sins

What John saw parallels with todays world in many ways, including in the desires of much of the world.

In Revelation 18, the invitation from the Lord is clear:

<Scripture
  title="Revelation 18:4"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/18.4?lang=eng"
>
  4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people,
  that ye <b>be not partakers of her sins</b>, and that ye receive not of her
  plagues.
</Scripture>

We are to avoid the sins of Babylon, which could include vices like addiction, dishonesty, greed, corruption, lust, and a slew of other things. King Benjamin said he couldn't list all the ways one could sin:

<Scripture
  title="Mosiah 4:29"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.29?lang=eng"
>
  29 And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin;
  for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.
</Scripture>

As there is opposition in all things, there are also innumerable ways that we can do good and serve others. A simple way to avoid the sins of Babyon is to occupy your time serving the children of God.

## If I am faithful, I will receive celestial glory

Because God honors his promises, we can know that keeping the commandments will result in our eventual exaltation.

To "he that overcometh", God is waiting to receive them.
