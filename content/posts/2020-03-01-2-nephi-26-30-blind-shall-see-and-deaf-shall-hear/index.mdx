This week President Nelson invited members to think about ways to "Hear Him". I found it aligned well with the sections from the Come, Follow Me reading for the past week.

2 Nephi 27:29 shares how the Book of Mormon unlocks the ability to hear, even for those that are deaf:

<Scripture
  title="2 Nephi 27:29"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.29?lang=eng"
>
  29 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of
  the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.
</Scripture>

The Book of Mormon seems to unlock 2 things:

1. That the deaf can become capable of hearing
2. That the blind can become capable of seeing

Seeing and hearing are mutually exclusive in that you can do one, and not the other. Depending on the parallel drawn between what deafness and blindness can mean, the scripture can take on different meaning.

By comparing this verse with the story of the man born blind in John 9, it begins to take on some new meaning (for another parallel story, see [1 Samuel 3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/3?lang=eng)).

The man born blind was able to hear the Lord even before he was capable of identifying Him. Later when the man's eyes are opened, he's able to both see _and_ hear the Lord:

<Scripture
  title="John 9:36-39"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/9.36-39?lang=eng"
>
  36 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?
  <br />
  37 And Jesus said unto him,{" "}
  <b>Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</b>
  <br />
  38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
  <br />
  39 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see
  not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.
</Scripture>

The combination of hearing and seeing with clarity is a unique blessing that the Book of Mormon brought with the Restoration.
