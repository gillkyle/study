I liked a verse in the Come Follow Me reading about the Book of Mormon persuading people to do good and believe in Jesus. It's in 2 Nephi 33:

<Scripture
  title="2 Nephi 33:4"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.4?lang=eng"
>
  4 And I know that the Lord God will consecrate my prayers for the gain of my
  people. And the words which I have written in weakness will be made strong
  unto them; for <b>it persuadeth them to do good</b>; it maketh known unto them
  of their fathers; and{" "}
  <b>it speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them to believe in him</b>, and to
  endure to the end, which is life eternal.
</Scripture>

I think it does just that. It's been on my mind because of Pres. Nelson's reminders to think about what your life would be like without the Book of Mormon. I'd probably do less good without the Book of Mormon and think less about Jesus, which would also lead to doing less good.
