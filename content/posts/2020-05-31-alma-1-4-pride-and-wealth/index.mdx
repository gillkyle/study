I found one verse in particular relevant to my own life contemplating decisions about job offers.

<Scripture
  title="Alma 1:6"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/1.6?lang=eng"
>
  6 And he began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to wear very
  costly apparel, yea, and even began to establish a church after the manner of
  his preaching.
</Scripture>

[How do I measure my life?](https://hbr.org/2010/07/how-will-you-measure-your-life) If it's with money some decisions become more obvious. Take a job that offers more money. When principles of righteousness are the focus the perspective shifts.

I think Nehor was doing some things that outwardly appeared "good". One could say he was teaching about the Lord and how He had "redeemed all men". Many truths punctuated by a few false notions and misdeeds. One contributing factor based on the above verse was pride. Nehor cared about the money and had already lost sight of what mattered.

Pride is a dangerous seed to plant and nurture, and one I was reminded to root up this week.
