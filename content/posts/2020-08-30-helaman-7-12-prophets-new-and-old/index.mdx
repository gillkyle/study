excerpt: How Nephi is just like Pres. Nelson

For each role of Nephi in the book of Helaman, Pres. Nelson (the current prophet) has made analagous calls to action. Nephi called his people to repent, Pres. Nelson [instructed the men of the Priesthood to rise up](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2019/04/36nelson?lang=eng), as well as the general church population to [respect the Savior by using His name in the Church](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/the-correct-name-of-the-church?lang=eng).

Just as there existed prophets in antiquity, so do they exist in modern times.
