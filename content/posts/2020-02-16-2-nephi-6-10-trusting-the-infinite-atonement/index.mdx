Reading Jacob's discourse to the Nephites made me reflect on one phrase in particular about the Atonement of Jesus Christ: "an infinite atonement".

## The implications of an infinite Atonement

<Scripture
  title="2 Nephi 9:7"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.7?lang=eng"
>
  7 Wherefore, it must needs be <b>an infinite atonement</b>â€”save it should be
  an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption.
  Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to
  an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to
  crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.
</Scripture>

Recognizing that the Atonement is infinite is easier to apply at a macro level, but more difficult to apply at a micro level. Because it is infinite it is easy to think that the Atonement is like a master key that can unlock anyone's chains by which they are bound. I'd offer a counter analogy that the Atonement is like the Savior possessing a unique key for each and every person that can unlock _their_ chains. The Atonement isn't about being enough to deal with everyone's problems or pains, it's about dealing with your specific problems.

The Atonement of Jesus Christ is not a one size fits all program.

Because God and the Savior love us individually, the plan is catered to us individually to the point that our sins were suffered for individually.

## An example in the temple recommend interview

The revised questions for members to obtain a temple recommend create an interesting point of emphasis. The old question (which was revised in 2019) said the following:

> Do you have a testimony of the Atonement of Christ and of His role as Savior and Redeemer?

Compare that question to the way the question was previously stated:

> Do you have a testimony of the Atonement of <span style={{color: `#c5a952`}}>Jesus</span> Christ and of His role as <span style={{color: `#c5a952`}}>your</span> Savior and Redeemer?

The revised question adds the word "your" (in addition to the word Jesus, adding another relevant title to the Atonement). This one word "your" reflects an individuality that I believe is so important in understanding the relevance of the Atonement of Jesus Christ in my own life.

I agree with Jacob:

<Scripture

  8 O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! ...
  <br />
  10 O how great the goodness of our God ...
  <br />
  13 O how great the plan of our God! ...
  <br />
  17 O the greatness and the justice of our God! ...
  <br />
  19 O the greatness of the mercy of our God, the Holy One of Israel! ...
  <br />
  20 O how great the holiness of our God! ...
  <br />
