excerpt: Christmas is a time of reflection, and the beautiful message that a child was capable of giving us a greater gift than we could give Him.

When Isaiah prophesied "For unto us, a child is born", could he grasp the meaning?

A new baby can be a symbol of hope. What the baby is capable of is yet to be determined, will they grow up to make good decisions and influence others for good, or chart their own path of self-interest?

Jesus was such a child, with a course set for great things, but were yet to be completed.

## Jesus Christ condescended to be born among us on earth

Like the angel asked Nephi:

<Scripture>
  16 And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?
</Scripture>

By coming to earth as a baby, Jesus completed a remarkably similar journey to the one we all do.

Christmas trees haven't been a common symbol of Christmas, but the symbol is strikingly similar to one that _has_ been talked about for thousands of years. We gather round the evergreen source of life and truth, bringing our gifts.

The tree of life actually represents the Savior, like 1 Nephi 11 demonstrates. When Nephi asks about the tree the angel shows him Jesus' birth. Later when Nephi says "Yea, it is the love of God", the angel says "Yes... but look what else" and shows the Savior's miracles on earth, and His mission to be baptized.

### Gifts fit for a King

Wise men sought the baby Jesus when the star appeared, when they arrived they presented gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. What seems excessive for a child—who likely doesn't seem the same value in luxury goods—is paled in comparison by the gift he offers them for nothing in return. Can we give a gift in exchange for victory over death?

A scripture from 2 Nephi comes to mind:

<Scripture>
  23 For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our
  brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that
  <b> it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.</b>
</Scripture>

Try as we might to make ourselves worthy of a gift that grants life over death, it is still after grace that we are saved.

## Jesus Christ fulfilled His mission and made it possible for me to inherit eternal life

Without the Atonement of Jesus Christ, there isn't any signicifance to the Christmas story. It's just a baby born in humble circumstances. It's what Jesus made of His life that creates the meaning.

### He Sent His Son

"Because God loved us He sent His son...", one of the most commonly cited Biblical verses states something powerful: it wasn't because of anything more than love that God was willing to offer His only begotten Son. It was the same for the Savior, there was no ulterior motive.

<Scripture>
  16 For God <b>so</b> loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
  whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
</Scripture>

God loves us, and because He does, we are able to live again and overcome sin.
