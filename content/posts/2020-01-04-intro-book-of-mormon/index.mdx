The Book of Mormon is a source of peace for anyone willing to read it and follow the principles it teaches. It is unlike other books in that it's not just about learning something new, and often more about feeling something new, or even feeling something familiar that you'd forgotten about.

## The Book of Mormon “outlines the plan of salvation”

Even though, the verbiage "only true and living church" makes salvation sound out of reach for people not of the same faith as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the theology taught in the Book of Mormon teaches that all can be saved. Even after this life there is a chance for redemption. Jacob explained it beautifully:

<Scripture
  title="2 Nephi 9:19-21"
  url="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.19-21?lang=eng"
>
  19 O the greatness of the mercy of our God, the Holy One of Israel! For he
  delivereth his saints from that awful monster the devil, and death, and hell,
  and that lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment. <br />
  20 O how great the holiness of our God! For he knoweth all things, and there is
  not anything save he knows it. <br />
  21 And he cometh into the world that{" "}
  <b>he may save all men if they will hearken unto his voice</b>; for behold, he
  suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both
  men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam.
</Scripture>

Saving all of humankind is only possible through an infinite atonement, something that is repeated and taught over and over in the Book of Mormon.

The manual for Come, Follow Me helps further explain why the Book of Mormon is so meaningful in relation to the Atonement of Jesus Christ:

> > The Atonement of Jesus Christ makes this plan possible, and every doctrine, ordinance, covenant, and commandment that God has given is meant to help accomplish the plan.

The Book of Mormon teaches the doctrines, ordinances, covenants, and commandments that make the plan _actually_ bring happiness.

## I can be a witness of the Book of Mormon

Just like the 3 and 8 witnesses who bore testimony of the Book of Mormon (more particularly, the plates), it's possible to have a personal witness.

Like Simon in the Bible we can know for ourselves through the Holy Ghost:

<Scripture
  title="Matthew 16:17"
  url="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/16.17?lang=eng"
>
  17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for
  flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in
  heaven.
</Scripture>

## The coming forth of the Book of Mormon was a miracle

The restoration is still ongoing and we are able to participate.

Joseph Smith was told his name "should be had for good and evil among all nations":

<Scripture
  title="Testimony of Joseph Smith"
  url="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/js?lang=eng"
>
  “He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the
  presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for
  me to do; and that my name{" "}
  <b>should be had for good and evil among all nations</b>, kindreds, and
  tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.
</Scripture>

Imagine if people weren't talking about Joseph Smith, would it seem like this prophecy were still forthcoming? For good or for bad, our generation fulfills the prophecy by speaking good or bad of Joseph Smith. Silence from the world is the only thing that it doesn't predict, which is the actual case of almost all of the rest of humanity.

Just as the coming forth of the Book of Mormon was a miracle, gaining a testimony of it is also a miracle. Knowing there is a second witness with the Bible to the actual divinity of the Savior is a powerful motivation and source of comfort.
