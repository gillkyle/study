There are 3 main characters of Alma 8-12:

1. Alma (the younger)
2. Amulek
3. Zeezrom

If you rewind time to look at each of their lives as they've grown up, each had seasons of relative wickedness. Alma the younger shares his story several times, he actively fought against the church. Zeezrom was actively fighting against Alma and Amulek when they came to Ammonihah to preach. Amulek has a less clear back story but it says the following in Alma 10:

<Scripture
  title="Alma 10:6"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/10.6?lang=eng"
>
  6 Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was called many times and I would
  not hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know;
  therefore I went on rebelling against God, in the wickedness of my heart, even
  until the fourth day of this seventh month, which is in the tenth year of the
  reign of the judges.
</Scripture>

Even Amulek had hardened his heart at one point and rebelled against God. It's notable that these are some of the key missionary examples in the Book of Mormon. The only missionary of perfect conduct was Jesus. It's unrealistic to expect perfection from missionaries or any religious leader, and even they come from very different (often difficult) backgrouonds.
