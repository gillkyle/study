The verse in 2 Nephi 25:20 gave me the most to think about this week:

<Scripture
  title="2 Nephi 25:20"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.20?lang=eng"
>
  20 And now, my brethren, <b>I have spoken plainly that ye cannot err.</b> And
  as the Lord God liveth that brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and
  gave unto Moses power that he should heal the nations after they had been
  bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they would cast their eyes unto the
  serpent which he did raise up before them, and also gave him power that he
  should smite the rock and the water should come forth; yea, behold I say unto
  you, that as these things are true, and as the Lord God liveth, there is none
  other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have
  spoken, whereby man can be saved.
</Scripture>

The fact that things are laid out plainly is of comfort to me. It's easy to overthink problems, start to imagine our own punishments for sin, or architect solutions for life's problems. Often times it's as simple as looking to the serpent to live.

Like 2 Nephi 2 mentions that ["men are instructed sufficiently"](/2-Nephi-1-5:-Agency-and-Repentance), the way is given.

"Because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer", salvation is possible, even though we may "err", the way back will always be clear and always available.
