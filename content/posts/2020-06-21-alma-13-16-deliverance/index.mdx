There's a theme of deliverance and fulfilled prophecy in the Come, Follow Me reading this week.

- Alma and Amulek breaking the cords they are bound by (also see [1 Nephi 18:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18.20?lang=eng))
- the city of Ammonihah falling in a single day (see [Alma 9:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/9.4?lang=eng))

I don't know from the story in Alma 14 how long Alma and Amulek were imprisoned, it's possible they cried for deliverance many times, but eventually it came.

<Scripture
  title="Alma 14:26"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14.26?lang=eng"
>
  26 And Alma cried, saying: How long shall we suffer these great afflictions, O
  Lord? O Lord, give us strength according to our faith which is in Christ, even
  unto deliverance. And they broke the cords with which they were bound; and
  when the people saw this, they began to flee, for the fear of destruction had
  come upon them.
</Scripture>

Deliverance comes like the sun rising. But every night isn't the same length, and I can't expect every promised blessing at an exact moment, though I can count on them coming.
