I liked a section from Come Follow Me that summarized some of the reading from the scriptures. It said:

<Scripture
  title="Come, Follow Me"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/come-follow-me-for-individuals-and-families-book-of-mormon-2020/17?lang=eng"
>
  Sometimes we’re like these captive Nephites, ... Sometimes we’re like Ammon,
  ... No matter our circumstances, we all need to repent.
</Scripture>

I like that repentance is a thing that isn't like a decision on a flow chart, but a constant thing. There isn't ever a time where you need to ask should I be repenting?

The answer is always yes.
