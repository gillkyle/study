When the father of King Lamoni stops Ammon, the word desire shows up a number of times. Take a look:

<Scripture
  title="Alma 20:24-27"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/20.24-27?lang=eng"
>
  24 Now when Ammon saw that he had wrought upon the old king according to his{" "}
  <Highlight>desire</Highlight>, he said unto him: If thou wilt grant that my
  brethren may be cast out of prison, and also that Lamoni may retain his
  kingdom, and that ye be not displeased with him, but grant that he may do
  according to his own <Highlight>desires</Highlight> in whatsoever thing he
  thinketh, then will I spare thee; otherwise I will smite thee to the earth.
  <br />
  25 Now when Ammon had said these words, the king began to rejoice because of
  his life.
  <br />
  26 And when he saw that Ammon had no <Highlight>desire</Highlight> to destroy
  him, and when he also saw the great love he had for his son Lamoni, he was
  astonished exceedingly, and said: Because this is all that thou hast{" "}
  <Highlight>desired</Highlight>, that I would release thy brethren, and suffer
  that my son Lamoni should retain his kingdom, behold, I will grant unto you
  that my son may retain his kingdom from this time and forever; and I will
  govern him no moreâ€”
  <br />
  27 And I will also grant unto thee that thy brethren may be cast out of
  prison, and thou and thy brethren may come unto me, in my kingdom; for I shall
  greatly <Highlight>desire</Highlight> to see thee. For the king was greatly
  astonished at the words which he had spoken, and also at the words which had
  been spoken by his son Lamoni, therefore he was{" "}
  <Highlight>desirous</Highlight> to learn them.
</Scripture>

Seeing desires in this story highlight a theme in the Book of Mormon prescribed in Alma 29.

<Scripture
  title="Alma 29:4"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.4?lang=eng"
>
  4 I ought not to harrow up in my desires the firm decree of a just God, for I
  know that{" "}
  <b>
    he granteth unto men according to their <Highlight>desire</Highlight>
  </b>
  , whether it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men,
  yea, decreeth unto them decrees which are unalterable, according to their wills,
  whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction.
</Scripture>

Interestingly, both good and evil desires tend to be granted. Agency seems powerful enough to actually be able to will someone to a result. But ultimately, **desires are granted**.

Back to the story of Ammon... all of the desires expressed were granted.

- Ammon wished for his brothers to be released from prison, which they were
- The King was desirous to see and learn from Ammon, which he did

This theme becomes an interesting study elsewhere in the Book of Mormon like with Amalickiah who [desired to lead the Lamanite armies](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/46.32?lang=eng), and does.

Knowing God is willing to grant what I desire (good or bad), means I need to keep my desires in check.
