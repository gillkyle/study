Nephi desired to see the same vision his father did, receiving additional context in a similar revelation. Turning the ordinary wilderness into a place of reflection turned into a personalized journey for learning for Nephi.

## Personal revelation can come through asking questions

When Nephi's brothers were struggling to understand Lehi's instruction, Nephi responded with a simple question:

<Scripture
  title="1 Nephi 15:8"

>
  8 And I said unto them: <b>Have ye inquired of the Lord?</b>
</Scripture>

This question comes at an interesting time when you consider what Nephi is coming from. Immediately after his vision, Nephi returns to the tent of his father and the first recorded statement from him is a question to his brothers who struggle to understand. A question.

Nephi is (maybe subconciously) following the teaching pattern of the angel he just learned from, guiding with questions that teach principles. Clearly, Nephi had learned that inquiring of the Lord resulted in learning and was attempting to convey that same message that he had learned.

_Understanding that revelation can be personal, and that anyone can inquire of the Lord is a powerful message of the Restoration that the Book of Mormon exemplifies clearly._

It is interesting to note that Nephi had just seen that these same brother's descendants would result in the destruction of his. Rather than lashing out Nephi takes time to try and help instruct them.

## The Lord was preparing the world for the Restoration

After his vision, Nephi knew he was fighting a losing battle. He saw that his descendants would kill themselves off, and it almost totally deflated him. Then, Nephi saw that the gospel would be restored. Even if his posterity would fail to prepare the world for the 2nd Coming, he saw those who would succeed. There were dispensations prior to Nephi who had fallen into iniquity just like his people would, but those prophets also saw that there would be a winning team capable in the latter days.

<Scripture

  34 ...I will be merciful unto the Gentiles in that day, insomuch that I will
  bring forth unto them, in mine own power, much of my gospel, which shall be
  plain and precious, saith the Lamb.
</Scripture>

Because God loves His children He would again provide His gospel, like had been done in the beginning where He provided a Savior for Adam and Eve. The tree that Nephi saw that he first labels as meaning the "Love of God", embodies the Savior himself.

_Just as it has always been from the beginning, God has prepared a Savior to lead His children to happiness, and He will always give His children the chance to learn about Him._
