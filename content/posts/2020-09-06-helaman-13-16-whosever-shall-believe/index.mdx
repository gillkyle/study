When all is said and done, Samuel the Lamanite summarizes things quite nicely with one verse in Helaman 14.

<Scripture
  title="Helaman 14:8"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.8?lang=eng"
>
  8 And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall believe on the Son of God,
  the same shall have everlasting life.
</Scripture>

I like that the Book of Mormon is full of so many statements like this. The gospel isn't incredibly complex. Things get more complex when you split hairs over what it means to believe on the Son of God, if I "believe", but don't act accordingly, am I saved for instance?

What exactly is everlasting life is another definition that requires some nuance, but I think it's okay to approach things simply and trust that things work out.
