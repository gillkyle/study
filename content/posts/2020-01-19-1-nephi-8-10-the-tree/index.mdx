Lehi's vision of the Tree of Life is rich with symbolism. As Pres. Boyd K Packer said: "You are in it; all of us are in it", meaning we can all apply principles from parallels in the vision.

## Symbol of the Tree and its fruit

Lehi partakes of the fruit of the tree and is filled with joy. The fruit was white (or pure). In the Old Testamnt, a similar story with a tree gives us a better understanding of what the symbolism of the tree could mean. After passing through the Red Sea on dry ground, Moses leads the children of Israel into the wilderness and for 3 days they find no water. They come to Marah and find bitter water, leading Moses to petition the Lord:

<Scripture

  title="Exodus 15:25"
>
  25 And he cried unto the Lord; and the Lord shewed him{" "}
  <b>
    a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet
  </b>
  : there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,
  <br />
  26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God,
  and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments,
  and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I
  have brought upon the Egyptians: <b>for I am the Lord that healeth thee</b>.
</Scripture>

The tree in both stories represents the Savior, who can provide us water to save us in the wilderness from bitter wells. It is the Savior who's pure fruit/works can fill us with joy.

A [post from Christmas](/christmas) discusses the Savior's representation as the tree as well.

Stopping to refocus on the Tree and remember what it actually means can provide a lasting sense of joy.

## Importance of Records

Just 10 chapters into the Book of Mormon the importance of records is emphasized several times. Returning for the brass plates, Nephi recording his father's vision again and making another separate record, it sets a precedent for later Nephite and Lamanite prophets that records are indeed important. From Nephi's writing in 1 Nephi 9, it's apparent he understood the value of recording what was happening, just as we should.
