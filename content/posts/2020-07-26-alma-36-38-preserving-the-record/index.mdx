The scriptural record is an important theme of Alma 37. The records are described as "retain[ing] their brightness" which hints at preservation. There are actually 2 ways they are preserved:

1. In an individual heart when a testimony is gained
2. In physical form, so that the words can be passed down

For evidence of point #1:

<Scripture
  title="Alma 37:16"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.16?lang=eng"
>
  16 But if ye keep the commandments of God, and do with these things which are
  sacred according to that which the Lord doth command you, (for you must appeal
  unto the Lord for all things whatsoever ye must do with them){" "}
  <b>behold, no power of earth or hell can take them from you</b>, for God is
  powerful to the fulfilling of all his words.
</Scripture>

And then evidence of point #2:

<Scripture
  title="Alma 37:18"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.18?lang=eng"
>
  18 For he promised unto them that{" "}
  <b>
    he would preserve these things for a wise purpose in him, that he might show
    forth his power unto future generations
  </b>
  .
</Scripture>

Just like keeping records is important at an individual level, so is it at a more macro level.
