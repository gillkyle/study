I love Ammons attitude in Alma 26. We know the story of the sons of Mosiah teaching the Lamanites and they didn't exactly have it that easy. If you read Alma 26 on its own you'd think their mission was a cake walk. There's quite a bit of optimism exhibited the whole time, which resembles how people talk about their own missions nowadays after the fact.

One scripture in particular shows just how positive he was:

<Scripture
  title="Alma 26:35"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.35?lang=eng"
>
  35 Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you,{" "}
  <b>
    there never were men that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the
    world began
  </b>
  ; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for he has all
  power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is
  a merciful Being, even unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe on
  his name.
</Scripture>
