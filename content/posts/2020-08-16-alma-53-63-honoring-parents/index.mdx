Just like the stripling warriors honored their earthly mothers, I found it insightful that they trusted in their heavenly parents too.

The commandment to honor thy father and thy mother seems like it's about not just about parents on earth, but teaches us to honor the advice of our spiritual parents.

<Scripture
  title="Alma 56:48"

  48 And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We do not
  doubt our mothers knew it.
</Scripture>

The sons of Helaman trusted God to deliver them, just as they trusted promises from their mothers.
