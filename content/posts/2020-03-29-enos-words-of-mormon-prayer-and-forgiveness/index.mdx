Enos, like Joseph Smith went into the woods to pray seeking forgiveness of his sins.

<Scripture
  title="Joseph Smith First Vision: Circa Summer 1832 History (page 2)"
  link="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-summer-1832/2"
>
  ...my mind become excedingly distressed for{" "}
  <b>I become convicted of my sins...</b>
  <br />
  <b>I felt to mourn for my own sins</b> and for the sins of the world...
</Scripture>

_Interestingly here, Joseph Smith (once again like Enos) is also concerned about the sins of the world._

<Scripture
  title="Enos 1:4"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.4?lang=eng"
>
  4 And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto
  him in <b>mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul</b>; and all the
  day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my
  voice high that it reached the heavens.
</Scripture>

Both go to the Lord in a state that doesn't necessarily seem to be one we'd expect of someone about to experience something fantastically spiritual. They both feel weighed down by sins, but unlike the natural man response to feeling weighed down by sin and turning away from God, they turn to Him.

I find this action incredibly insightful. Enos and Joseph were probably rather average people at the recorded instances, and they express feelings that are entirely commonplace. Their respones, however, are extraordinary. They turn to God and seek forgiveness, when the adversary would rather make us feel we aren't worthy of God's company.

The resolution of both stories is forgiveness, a beautiful side effect of prayer:

<Scripture
  title="Joseph Smith First Vision: Circa Summer 1832 History (page 3)"
  link="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-summer-1832/3"
>
  And he spake unto me, saying,{" "}
  <b>â€œJoseph, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee</b>. Go thy way, walk in my
  statutes, and keep my commandments. Behold, I am the Lord of glory. I was
  crucified for the world, that all those who believe on my name may have
  eternal life....
</Scripture>

And then Enos' take:

<Scripture
  title="Enos 1:5"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.5?lang=eng"
>
  5 And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos,{" "}
  <b>thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.</b>
</Scripture>

I enjoy realizing that turning to God, even in a moment of despair or heartache is often rewarded by relief from difficult emotions. ["Faith still precedes the miracles"](https://kylegill.com/blog/2020-03-16-a-farewell-address/#faith-still-precedes-the-miracles), as it did in Enos' day.
