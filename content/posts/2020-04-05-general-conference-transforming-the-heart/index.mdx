I enjoyed how much of the content from the sessions of April 2020 General Conference overlapped, and several themes keep getting brought up. The one that—by far—stuck out to me the most was the idea of the Lord transforming our hearts.

The first time it came up was the very first thing Pres. Nelson said (something along the lines of) the most important effect of conference will be changing our hearts in a new lifelong mission to Hear Him.

Then, Elder Anderson's talk felt personally meaningful, because he talked about recording personal spiritual experiences. It hit close to home because I did something similar recording personal spiritual experiences during my years at BYU in [a blog post](https://kylegill.com/blog/2020-03-16-a-farewell-address/). In my blog post I wrapped up all my lessons into one scripture from Hebrews 8:

<Scripture
  title="Hebrews 8:10"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/8.10?lang=eng"
>
  10 I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I
  will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.
</Scripture>

Multiple companion scriptures to that one in Hebrews have been quoted in conference now:

- Elder Rasband who spoke about a changed heart in a heart transplant being like our changed hearts and receiving a "new heart"
- Elder Bednar who spoke about the hearts of the children being turned to the fathers and how the heart represents our innermost emotions
- finally, Pres. Nelson who spoke in his last talk about the new proclamation which is a monument of words not to be written on tablets of stone, but "the fleshy tables of the heart".

God can replace whatever stony, aged, problems or pains we may feel in our hearts, with a _new heart_.

<Scripture
  title="Ezekiel 11:19"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/11.19?lang=eng"
>
  19 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and
  I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of
  flesh
</Scripture>
