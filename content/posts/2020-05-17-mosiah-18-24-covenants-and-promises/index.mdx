Two scriptures in this week's Come Follow Me reading have a lot of similarites. Compare the bolded sections in these 2 scriptures:

<Scripture
  title="Mosiah 18:8-9"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8-9?lang=eng"
>
  8 And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of
  Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are desirous to come into
  the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to{" "}
  <b>bear one another’s burdens</b>, that they may be light;
  <br />9 Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and <b>
    comfort those that stand in need of comfort
  </b>, and to <b>stand as witnesses of God</b> at all times and in all things, and
  in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God,
  and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal
  life—
</Scripture>
<Scripture
  title="Mosiah 24:13-14"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.13-14?lang=eng"
>
  13 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their
  afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and <b>be of good comfort</b>, for I
  know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with{" "}
  <b>my people</b> and deliver them out of bondage.
  <br />
  14 And I will also <b>ease the burdens</b> which are put upon your shoulders,
  that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage;
  and this will I do that ye may <b>stand as witnesses</b> for me hereafter, and
  that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit <b>my people</b>{" "}
  in their afflictions.
</Scripture>

- burdens
- comfort
- stand as witnesses
- his people

It's clear God is still very aware of covenants made when the promises the people made when being baptized in chapter 18 are echoed almost exactly in chapter 24.
