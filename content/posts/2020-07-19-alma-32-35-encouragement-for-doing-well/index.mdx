My favorite part of this week's reading was in the suggested talk What Lack I Yet?

<Scripture
  title="What Lack I Yet?"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2015/10/what-lack-i-yet?lang=eng"
>
  The Spirit can show us our weaknesses, but He is also able to show us our
  strengths.{" "}
  <b>
    Sometimes we need to ask what we are doing right so that the Lord can lift
    and encourage us.
  </b>
</Scripture>

This quote that tells me it is okay to ask how I am doing well is comforting to me when I spend so much time focusing on my shortcomings.
